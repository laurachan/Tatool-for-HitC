Modifications from Tatool 1.2.1

Major changes for Heads in the Cloud (HitC):
	1)	App.main() receives arguments determining which HitC Tatool module
		is to be opened at startup.
		
	2) 	LoginFrame renamed to LoginManager and GUI components removed; 
		a single user account is used and automatically loaded instead
		of having the user select or create an account
		
	3)	ModuleManagerFrame renamed to ModuleManager and GUI components removed;
		now loads the module specified by the App.main() arguments instead of
		listing the user's modules and letting the user pick/load one. Uses a
		single LocalFileModuleCreator instead of having a registry that can
		contain several module creators.
		
	4)	LocalFileModuleCreator no longer shows a file chooser but instead
		retrieves the module file for the module specified by the arguments
		
	5)	GuiController.java refactored to reflect the above changes
	
	6)	Reduced the number of CSV files exported by ServerDataExporter and 
		adjusted POST parameters to use those expected by the HitC server
